# Circullarly-Linked-List-
This repo is from a project that utilizes java arrays to create a circularly linked list. One application was creating a receipt system and another fun one was making a automated Hot Potato game. 

# File Organization-
Prog2.java, Prog3.java, Prog4.java, contain code written as applications of CList.java. If in Python, they would be the "main" files. 

CList.java is the circullary linked list data structure and its accompanying methods to use

Item.java is a initializer and printer of items in Prog3

Link.java contains constructors and methods for links. Written by Clifford A. Shaffer. 

Player.java is for the Hot Potato game in prog4. Contains initializers and methods to call on.
